                    <p>The Cheong Wa Dae site reappeared in history around the time the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) replaced Goryeo, and many clamored to relocate the capital to around the site. After Joseon's main royal palace of Gyeongbokgung was built, its rear garden was created at the current Cheong Wa Dae site in 1426, the eighth year of King Sejong's reign.During that time, Seohyeonjeong Pavilion, Yeonmujang Court for martial arts training and Gwageojang Court for national civil service exams were added to the garden.The grandeur of Gyeongbokgung and its rear garden was burned to the ground in 1592 during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Their ruins remained for nearly 270 years until 1865, when Prince Regent Heungseon began reconstruction in the second year of King Gojong’s reign.</p>

The location was later renamed Gyeongmudae..</p>
